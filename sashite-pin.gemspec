  spec.description = <<~DESC
    PIN (Piece Identifier Notation) provides a rule-agnostic format for identifying pieces
    in abstract strategy board games. This gem implements the PIN Specification v1.0.0 with
    a modern Ruby interface featuring immutable identifier objects and functional programming
    principles. PIN uses single ASCII letters with optional state modifiers and case-based
    side encoding (A-Z for first player, a-z for second player), enabling precise and portable
    identification of pieces across multiple games. Perfect for game engines, board game notation
    systems, and hybrid gaming platforms requiring compact, stateful piece representation.
